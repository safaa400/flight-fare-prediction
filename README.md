# flight-fare-prediction

In this project , my objective is to predict flight price based on various features like Airline,Date_of_Journey,Source,Destination,Route,Dep_Time,Arrival_Time,Duration
,Total_Stops.I performed all steps from choosing the data to be used till pickling the best model for our data after performing fine-tuning .I used random forest regressor 
for prediction , and I also used extra trees regressor for feature engineering . 


## Technique used 
- Data Cleaning 
- Data Encoding
